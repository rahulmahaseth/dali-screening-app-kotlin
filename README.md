## About
The purpose of this screening tool is to identify children who may have learning disability, which hinders their school performance. The screening tool is designed to be comprehensive, so that it can be used as a referral questionnaire. If there is evidence that suggests a possible learning disability, the child will need to be referred for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.

This screening tool is designed for children from classes 1 to 5(5 to 10 years). As per language research, children should be screened in all the languages in which they receive instruction.
Therefore, this tool should be administered by a Language teacher and the Class teacher.
